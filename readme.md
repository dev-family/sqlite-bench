# PostgreSQL & SQLite Speed Test

We tried to compare the speed of SQLite and PostgreSQL during the simplest operations of inserting, updating and extracting data from a spreadsheet.  
You should know that SQLite is a single file, while PostgreSQL is a whole server with many additional functions.  
As we can see, the speed of SQLite due to its simplicity significantly exceeds PostgreSQL. For example:
- The insertion speed is 10 times higher.
- The sampling rate turned out to be 30 times higher.
- The update rate is almost identical to PostgreSQL.

Thatâ€™s why we can conclude that SQLite will be an excellent choice if you need a database to store a small amount of data and do not need to do complex manipulations.

### How to run

```bash
$ docker-compose up
